Input:
s = Geeks
Output: skeeG
============================
Explanation:- The provided C++ code defines a function named reverseWord that takes a string str as input and returns a new string that is the reverse of the input string. The function works by iterating over the original string from the last character to the first, effectively reversing the order of the characters. 

Inside the function, an empty string ans is initialized to store the reversed characters. A for loop is used to traverse the input string str in reverse order, starting from the last character (which is at index str.length() - 1) and moving towards the first character (index 0). During each iteration of the loop, the current character is appended to ans. After the loop completes, ans contains the reversed string, which is then returned as the output. For instance, if the function is called with reverseWord("hello"), the result will be "olleh". This function is a simple and efficient way to reverse the characters of a string.

solution/code:-
=================
string reverseWord(string str)
    {
        // Your code goes here
        string ans="";
        for(int i=str.length()-1; i>=0; i--){
            ans+=str[i];
           
        }
         return ans;
        
    }
